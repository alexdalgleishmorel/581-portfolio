        <h3 class="title">Description</h3>
        <p>
            The motivation of this project was to solve an issue about how content is curated and advertised to me. I've
            found recently that I get advertisements for clothing and accessories that I have no interest in, strictly since
            I'd liked a certain post, or may have visited certain websites. This feels like it has taken away the personal aspect
            of what it means to truly like something.

            <br/><br/>

            For the mirror proxemics project, the idea is to curate content based on the user's physical reaction to the content,
            to allow for the most personalized experience possible. The mirror is designed to help its users visualize how certain
            clothing and accessories would look on them, and help them to curate a list of clothes that they truly like and think looks
            good on them. Ultimately, this curated list can be what they use to go out and buy the items.

            <br/><br/>

            A user approaches the user, and a facial recognition scan determines their identity, and pulls their profile information if
            it exists, otherwise a new profile is created. If the user begins close to the mirror, smaller accessories are then displayed
            on them. When the user reacts positively, that accessory is added to their list of liked items. When reacting in an non-happy
            expression, the item is ignored or removed from the liked list if it was previously there.

            <br/><br/>

            Next, the user can move further away from the mirror. At that point, larger accessories like shirts, jackets, dresses and hoodies
            are displayed on the user. They can then react again to curate those items. When they are done, they can use the mobile app to go
            through their results. If a new user approaches the mirror, a new profile is loaded and the process repeats.

            <p>
                This idea was one of the main motivations behind the mirror project. It pursues a
                different way of curating media content based on the facial expression of the user. This
                type of reaction-based on content creation feels much more authentic and better captures
                whether a user truly likes the media they are consuming.

                This idea again focused on social media and improving ease of use. Specifically, I struggle
                when watching videos while moving around my home, specifically in terms of being able to hear
                what is being said. If the distance of the user from the device was tracked, the volume could
                be adjusted accordingly so that the content can always be heard.

            </div>
            <p>
                This idea was inspired by the Alexa at my home. We can ask Alexa to toggle on lights within our home,
                but anything with a dimmer cannot be controlled, and we have to speak to make it happen. This proxemics
                interaction would allow the user to look at a light, and then make a gesture to control the level of intensity
                of the light.

                This idea utilizes identification within proxemics as a way of protecting youth against media that shouldn't
                be consumed for someone their age. By identifying the user, their age can be determined, and in turn, the content
                displayed on surrounding devices could be sensored to remove any content deemed inappropriate by their guardian.

            </div>
            <p>
                This idea leverages identification and distance to optimize dog doors. The concept is that the door would open
                under two conditions. First, the animal approaches must be identified to be the pet registered by the family. Also,
                the pet must be within a certain distance of the door before it opens, to ensure the door is only opened briefly, when
                necessary.

                This was the first idea for the proxemic mirror. It was inspired by the original idea of curating social media content
                based on the user's reaction. I felt that this could be taken a step further into the physical world, by curating
                physical content. This would solve a problem I stuggle with, by reducing the difficulty of having to try on new clothes, by
                making that process as easy as possible.

                This idea further explores the proxemic mirror, by incorporating distance-based tracking into its functionality. Specifically,
                when the user approaches closer to the mirror, the clothing they try on becomes smaller accessories like necklaces, glasses, hats, etc. When
                they move away from the mirror, they are shown larger items like shirts, jackets, etc.

                This idea explores a meeting room that has been enhanced by proxemics. Specifically, the attendees of the meeting
                are identified by their facial features, and in turn, the content of the meeting is displayed based on that group of
                people. This could be used to optimize meetings to only show points that are relevant to the specific attendees involved.

            </div>
            <p>
                This idea was another ideation on a proxemics-based smart mirror. This mirror would again leverage distance and
                identification to remind users of important aspects of their health. When the user is close to the mirror, they would
                be displayed detailed information on the status of their health. When far away from the user, less text would appear,
                and instead by replaced with larger icons, for example a big water droplet to remind them to drink more water.

                This last idea was to have a camera positioned with an over-arching view of a swimming pool. The camera would identify
                at-risk users by taking into account their identification to correlate their swimming ability, distance away from the nearest
                exit, their facial expressions, and even how they are interacting with other swimmers. All this data could be aggregated and
                analyzed to determine if swimmers were at risk of drowning, and real lifeguards could then be notified in advance.

                In this first story, the user is just like me and is stuggling to imagine how certain clothes will look on them. They approach
                the proxemics mirror, and once close enough, potential clothes are super-imposed over their body. The user is pleased
                with the shirt they see in the mirror, and they smile. Their smile is processed as a postive reaction to the clothing, and
                the shirt is added to their currated list of liked items.

                In this second story, the user is continuing with their mirror experience. This time, an article is displayed that they do not
                like, and the mirror detects an unhappy response to the article. A new piece of cloting is immediately displayed, and the user
                preferences are updated to reflect the user did not like that article, to improve future clothing suggestions for that specific user.

                In this third story, the user approaches very close to the mirror. They are then presented with a detailed necklace, which they smile at
                the sight of, and in turn the necklace is added to their list of liked items. The user then scrolls through their liked items, and taps on
                the newly-added necklace. This navigates them to the vendor, where they are able to purchase the item. Lasty, a new user approaches the mirror. They
                are identified as an existing user, and their preferences are loaded into the system, and an outfit currated for them is promptly super-imposed. The curation
                process then repeats itself for this new user.

        <h3 class="title">Video + Final Product</h3>
        <iframe id="youtubeVideo" width="90%" height="300px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ax2v70w0zj8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h5>Final implementation</h5>
        <p>
            This project was ultimately implemented as an Angular application, leveraging the faceapi.js library. Using this library, the app
            is capable of facial identification, facial expression interpretation, and the ability to calculate the distance the user is from
            the user based on the size of the bounding box of their face.

            <br/><br/>

            Combining all these features together, the faceapi.js library provided all the core functionality required for it to be relatively
            seemless experience for new users. In the provided demo video, a group of my friends are interacting with the mirror for the first time,
            but they don't have touch the application at all, they simply interact with the mirror by moving around and changing their expression.
        </p>
        <h5>How does the application fit the objective?</h5>
        <p>
            This application achieves all the core objectives outlined in the storyboard. Different users that approach the mirror are identified, and
            their relevant profile information is loaded. When they are close to the mirror, they experiment with glasses, hats, sunglasses, scarfs, necklaces, etc. As
            they move further away, they try on sports jerseys, dresses, coats, shirts and more. All this without requiring any markings or other placements
            that would stray away from an organic exprience where the only object is the mirror itself.
        </p>
        <h5>What worked and what didn't work</h5>
        <p>
            The facial recognition worked well for identifying users, as well as determing how far away they were from the mirror. This allowed
            for a positive exprience for the user where they could allow themselves to truly imagine how the clothing would look on them, which
            was the core objective.

            <br/><br/>

            The facial expression detection was something that could be improved upon. Although it was easy to discern when a user was smiling, it was
            much harder to determine if they disliked an article of clothing. If this could be more accurate, the users would not have to make such
            exaggerated gestures to show the mirror they didn't like the item. This would likely lead to more accurate curration results as well.

            <br/><br/>

            Additionally, if given more time, I would like to have added more backend functionality to the facial recognition. For example, determining if
            the user was male or female, and currating initial clothing suggestions based on that assumption for a better user experience.
